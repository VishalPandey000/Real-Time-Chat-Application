 # Real-Time-Chat-Application
This is a simple real-time chat application built using Python, Flask, WebSockets, HTML, CSS and Javascript. It allows multiple users to chat with each other instantly in different chat rooms. The app uses WebSockets for real-time messaging and multithreading to handle multiple users at the same time. It runs on localhost and is a great example of real-time communication in Python.
